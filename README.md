**Nubank** is an educational clone of the Nubank app interface, built with **Flutter**. This project was developed as part of a Design Study.

The goal is to dive into Flutter development by exploring best practices in Mobile Design, recreating a well-known interface as a way to practice and improve technical skills. It's ideal for anyone looking to learn, experiment, and grow as a mobile developer.
